STEP 1 CONVERT MIDI TO TXT
	a. Open the Midi file with Sublime (Notepad++ will not work - it will look like garbage).
	b. Select all and paste into a txt document.
	c. Save into same folder as the ConvertMIDItoC.jar file (directory listed later for reference).

STEP 2 RUN JAR
	a. To run the jar file, open the command prompt and navigate to the following directory:
		
		mrone\robotcode\roneLibs\roneos\src\Audio\ConvertedMIDIFiles\MIDI
	
		(I know it's long. Copy & Paste)
	
	b. Type the following command into the prompt:

		java -jar ConvertMIDItoC.jar a.text b
	
		*a = file name of the midi text
		*b = what you want the new file to be called (no extensions)
	
		For example, to generate the Boogie Woogie file, you would type:
		java -jar ConvertMIDItoC.jar Boogie_Woogie.txt Boogie
	
	c. Add new .c and .h files to the SVN and commit! YAY! COOL SOUNDS! 
		
		*There is no need to commit the MIDI or TXT files.
